# Probably the simplest implementations of [fantasy-land](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land) you've seen so far.

## Usage
Install it using npm.  
```
npm Install [--save] fanta
```
There is no such a thing as "dist" files, you'll need to use a module bundler to
use it on the browser.

I have nothing close to a documentation right now, sorry. But you can always visit
the test files to get a clue of how to use the library.
